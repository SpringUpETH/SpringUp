      Independent creators deal with censorship, high fees, and poor audience engagement with the present funding models. With SpringUp, creators and supporters don't have these problems. Creators get censorship free, low fee funding. Supporters get perks based on how early they supported, how much they interact, and how much they give. Creators early on in their career benefit way more now.
